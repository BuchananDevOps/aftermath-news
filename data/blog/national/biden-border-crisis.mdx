# America's Southern Border Crisis

302,034 illegal immigrants crossed the southern border in December 2023. These record breaking numbers being reported by Customers and Border protection officers speak for themselves, 2.5 million migrants were released by the Biden administrations parole system into the country during the past year, while we hear the white house press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre make claims daily trying to portray the current border crisis as an issue that has trickled over from the Trump Administration. During Trump's time in office, 2.8 million migrants were deported from the country under title 42.

Statistics regarding interactions with illegal immigrants coming from Customs and Border Patrol are at an all time high, but the true extent of those who enter the country undetected remains unknown. Additionally, there's a lack of clarity concerning the demographics of those crossing the border; they could potentially include gang members, terrorists, or individuals with violent criminal backgrounds. Compounding these concerns is the ongoing fentanyl drug crisis in the U.S.

Conversations regarding the current immigration policy are consistently evaded during White House Press Briefings, with Karine Jean-Pierre adeptly sidestepping questions related to the border crisis. It's disheartening to witness individuals in positions of power diminish the press, especially when they're earnestly seeking answers to the pressing questions that concern our citizens. The level of arrogance and disregard exhibited is deeply troubling. The Biden administration is falling short of its duties to U.S. citizens on an unprecedented scale, refusing to acknowledge the significant threat our country faces.

When will we start prioritizing these security concerns? Over the last fortnight, we've witnessed alarming incidents. An NYPD officer was brazenly attacked on the streets by a gang of illegal immigrants, followed by Alejandro Rivas-Figueroa's reckless shooting spree in Times Square, which tragically injured an innocent tourist. These incidents are merely indicative of a larger problem. How can we allow these lawless immigrants to freely roam our communities and urban centers?

In addition to incidents of petty crime, shootings, and drug-related offenses, there are reports indicating a significant shift in the demographic composition of individuals crossing the border, with a rising number hailing from Asian and Middle Eastern origins. While instances of terrorism involving South American citizens are rare, there have been instances of radicalized behavior among Middle Eastern Muslims. This raises concerns about the potential infiltration of the country by individuals from other regions, such as Chinese nationals. Without conducting thorough security background checks on these individuals, it becomes difficult to ascertain the risks they may pose. Furthermore, many of these illegal immigrants involved in criminal activities or terrorism do not use their real names or proper documentation when entering the country, making it challenging to obtain their criminal history or military records for follow-up investigations.

Initially, the Biden administration attributed the southern border crisis to budget constraints. However, it's challenging to reconcile this assertion with the substantial funding allocated for two proxy wars. Initially, 60 billion was earmarked for Ukraine over the first two years, and an additional aid package exceeding 105 billion has been assembled to support various countries engaged in the ongoing power struggle in the Middle East. While the current aid package includes 13.6 billion for addressing the border crisis, it feels belated, especially as the Texas National Guard has had to intervene to reinforce the border at Eagle Pass, where upwards of 8,000 illegal immigrants are crossing on any given day. Eagle Pass has essentially become a militarized zone, with Texas staunchly resisting the influx of illegal immigrants into their communities. Despite claims by the federal government that barriers and barbed wire impede Customs and Border Patrol agents, it's evident that these agents have access to the relevant areas, such as the boat ramp and banks of Eagle Pass, to apprehend illegal immigrants as needed.

The current challenge transcends the southern border alone. After Title 42 wasn‚Äôt in effect, Texas Governor Greg Abbott is quoted saying Texas will also pass laws to mirror the federal immigration laws President Joe Biden refuses to enforce that will reduce illegal immigration and enhance the safety of Texans. In 2022 Governor Abbott expanded the scope of the immigration issue nationwide with Operation Lone Star by relocating illegal immigrants out of his state to sanctuary cities like Chicago, Philadelphia, Denver, Los Angeles, D.C., and New York. This mass relocation represents an unprecedented scale of action in American history. The issue has gone from a few southern states bearing the weight and cost of these illegal immigrants to Chicago and New York which have begun expressing on a national level that the border crisis is affecting them and bankrupting their cities' budgets at the moment.

Peter Santinello operates a widely viewed YouTube channel where he extensively documented the impact of immigrants on public services in Chicago in his video titled ‚ÄúEx-Chicago Cop Speaks Out üá∫üá∏‚Äù. If you wish to witness firsthand the consequences of illegal immigration in a sanctuary city, including how immigrants are housed in police precincts' front lobbies and hear firsthand accounts of their journeys here, as well as the benefits they receive from the Biden Administration after Title 42.

## Why Title 42?

![immigration-title-42](/articles/national/bidens-border-crisis/immigration-title-42.jpg)

The public health order was implemented to curb the spread of COVID-19, recognizing the potential for infected individuals to enter the U.S. illegally through the southern border and exacerbate the disease's transmission. Title 42 essentially empowered Customs and Border Patrol to expel illegal immigrants immediately, without providing avenues for them to seek asylum in the U.S.

Contrary to the understanding of many American citizens, prior to COVID-19, most illegal immigrants apprehended at the border were processed, assigned a court date for their asylum hearing, and subsequently released into the country. For these individuals, being caught by Customs and Border Patrol was advantageous, as it transformed them from illegal migrants into asylum seekers. This status granted them access to a cell phone for communication regarding the asylum process, a monthly paycheck from the social security system surpassing that of some elderly citizens, and housing assistance.

The implementation of Title 42 brought about a significant shift in the behavior of illegal immigrants crossing the southern border. Once they grasped the implications of the new policy and its enforcement, their tactics changed overnight. Previously, being caught by authorities had its benefits; however, after Title 42, immigrants sought to evade detection at all costs. Despite having statistics on the number of illegal immigrants deported to Mexico, the true extent of those who entered the country undetected remains unknown.

From a logical standpoint, one would expect that anyone caught attempting to illegally enter a foreign country would face immediate deportation to their home country. The idea that individuals are being paroled into the country contradicts the presumed policy with Customs and Border Patrol, as many Americans understand it.

As a native-born American citizen, I always assumed that anyone apprehended entering our country illegally would be deported to establish a precedent. While some argue that everyone deserves the American Dream, there are legal avenues for pursuing it. Each year, there are visa allocations, providing opportunities for individuals to come to the U.S. legally and pursue their aspirations. Monitoring and tracking those who enter legally through their visa and work status enable us to uphold immigration laws while offering lawful pathways to those seeking a better life in America.
