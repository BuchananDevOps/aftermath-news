# Truckers for Trump

Truck drivers who are supporters of former President Donald Trump have expressed their decision not to drive to New York City in protest of their dissatisfaction with the civil fraud judgment that imposed a fine of over 350 million on Mr. Trump.

On February 16, Judge Arthur Engoron ruled that Mr. Trump, along with his two sons, associates from the Trump Organization, and Trump properties, were held liable for tens of millions of dollars. While Mr. Trump, his companies, and his trust were mandated to pay over 350 million plus interest, his sons were also directed to pay roughly 4 million. This verdict has sparked discontent among numerous truck drivers across the nation.

An individual known as Chicago Ray shared a video on X platform following the ruling, stating, "I've been on the radio conversing with drivers for about the past hour, and I've spoken to approximately 10 drivers." He further mentioned that truckers plan to "refrain from accepting loads starting on Monday."

"I can't say for certain how widespread this sentiment is across the country or how many truckers will refuse loads heading to New York City, but let me tell you somethingâ€”mess around and find out," he asserted.

"We're fed up with you leftist individuals messing with Trump," he continued, donning a Trump-branded cap. "Our employers won't mind if we decline the loads. We'll simply go elsewhere, alright? Do you know how challenging it is to navigate one of these vehicles into New York City?"
