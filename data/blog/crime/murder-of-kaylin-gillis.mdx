On the fateful evening of April 15, 2023, at approximately 10 p.m., Kaylin Gillis found herself innocently traversing unfamiliar territory with friends in search of a mutual acquaintance's residence. Their journey took an unfortunate turn when they inadvertently entered the wrong driveway. A routine maneuver to rectify the mistake quickly transformed into a harrowing ordeal.


# The Incident

As the group of two cars embarked on a tight turnabout to correct their course, an unexpected tragedy unfolded. The first vehicle executed the maneuver without incident, but as the second car, carrying Kaylin, completed its turn, two gunshots reverberated from a 20-gauge shotgun, altering the course of that night irreversibly. The result: a devastating wound to Kaylin's neck.

Behind the wheel of the ill-fated vehicle was Kaylin's boyfriend, who, in the immediate aftermath, sought to contact emergency services. Hindered by poor cellphone reception in the area, the urgency of their situation propelled them to hastily navigate to the neighboring town of Salem, where a connection with emergency services was established. Regrettably, the intervention came too late to save Kaylin.

The ominous driveway belonged to Kevin Monahan, situated on a ridgetop property in Washington County, New York. Upon the arrival of law enforcement, a tense standoff unfolded as Kevin adamantly resisted surrendering to the authorities. Communicating with his lawyer and a police dispatcher, Kevin asserted he had been in bed since 8:30 p.m., insinuating that hunters might be responsible for the tragedy.

Throughout the ensuing investigation, Kevin's narratives took various turns. Initially blaming hunters, he later adopted a confrontational and hot-tempered demeanor when confronted with contradictory evidence. Subsequently, as he faced charges of intentional murder, his narrative shifted to portray the incident as a freak accident caused by a stray bullet from a supposed warning shot, conveniently omitting the fact that two shots were fired at the vehicles.

Charged with second-degree murder on April 16, 2023, Kevin Monahan entered a plea of not guilty. Denied bail the following day, his reputation for being confrontational and hot-tempered, coupled with the gravity of the crime, factored into the decision for pretrial detention.

In May 2023, a new indictment expanded the charges to include reckless endangerment and tampering with evidence, while the murder charge was downgraded from intentional murder to reckless depraved indifference murder. Despite repeated requests, Kevin's plea for bail was again rejected. Procedural delays pushed back the trial's jury selection to October 30, following which, on January 8, 2024, the trial was scheduled to commence after the presiding judge granted a defense request for additional time to seek expert analysis of certain evidence.

## The Two Week Trial

During the two-week trial, the 66-year-old Mr. Monahan took the stand, asserting that the fatal shot had been an inadvertent occurrence. He claimed that the gun discharged spontaneously as he tripped on his porch, having fired an initial warning shot upon sighting a convoy of two cars and a motorcycle approaching his residence at night. His defense painted him as an elderly individual, asleep and gripped by fear that a supposed group of assailants, akin to marauders, had come to attack him and his wife, Jinx, who was concealed inside the house, armed in self-defense.

However, authorities cast doubt on the level of threat Mr. Monahan perceived that night, emphasizing that the vehicles were in the process of leaving. Prosecutors expressed skepticism about his narrative, contending in their closing statement that Mr. Monahan's actions reflected animus and callous disregard for individuals who had unintentionally entered his property, suggesting he was motivated by anger rather than fear.

"Christian P. Morris, the first assistant district attorney for Washington County, addressing the jury in a nearly full courtroom, asserted, Kevin Monahan did not act out of fear; he acted out of a baser emotion than that: He acted out of anger.

The jury, seemingly unconvinced by Mr. Monahan's explanation, swiftly rendered three guilty verdicts, including charges of reckless endangerment and tampering with evidence related, in part, to efforts to clean the shotgun post-shooting. Body-cam footage and 911 calls further exposed falsehoods initially presented to authorities, with Mr. Monahan and his wife providing inaccurate information about having no visitors that night and feigning confusion about the gunshots.

The death of Ms. Gillis sent shockwaves through the local community and resonated nationwide, marking another tragic incident in a country all too familiar with gun-related deaths. The trial shed light on the horrifying moments following the shooting, with friends testifying to the sudden flash of the shotgun and the terrifying realization of Ms. Gillis being hit.

Despite Mr. Monahan's reputation as a somewhat surly figure with private property signs warning trespassers, his defense maintained that the shotgun fired accidentally after he stumbled on a porch nail, supported by a single test in which the weapon discharged when dropped. The victim's father, Andrew Gillis, expressed his desire for a severe punishment, stating, I just hope to God he dies in jail.

The family's lawyer, Donald W. Boyajian, conveyed relief and gratitude for the verdict while acknowledging the continued mourning. Washington County District Attorney J. Anthony Jordan described the tragedy as unimaginable and hoped the verdict provided some solace to Ms. Gillis's family and friends.

The sentencing is set for March 1, with Mr. Monahan facing a potential 25 years to life in state prison. Mr. Morris emphasized that Mr. Monahan stood on an elevated porch, more than 20 feet above the turning vehicles about 80 feet away, dismissing any notion of a threat and categorizing the individuals as lost kids rather than marauding raiders.
