John Buchanan, a Full Stack Web Developer, specializes in crafting and building websites tailored for small to medium-sized enterprises. Despite lacking formal training in journalism or writing, John adeptly curates narratives and entrusts Chat GPT to transform his content into compelling news pieces, imbuing them with the refined voice expected from a New York Times correspondent.


This blog serves as John's platform to articulate his perspectives on global news narratives and events, which he perceives as often skewed by the mainstream media in a manner unsuitable for the average individual. Formerly an independent observer, John's stance has shifted towards aligning more closely with Republican viewpoints, prompted by his observations of the country's current trajectory under President Joe Biden, and his growing disillusionment with what he perceives as the radicalized ideologies within liberal circles. 

He communicates straightforward wisdom to the everyday person. This isn't a space designed for comfort. If the reporting here unsettles you, that's intentional. Please refrain from emailing or messaging to debate the viewpoints presented. In simple terms, move along.
